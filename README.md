# Analysis and Clustering
This project is one from many advanced assignment in RevoU Full Stack Data Analytics bootcamp.

**Overview**

Gustavo just started an e-commerce startup based in Portugal that recently opened an online website to sell their product. Fortunately, Gustavo is launching their website when the covid-19 hits and making them grow faster than ever. However, Gustavo is still not using targeted marketing which hurts their marketing budget as only a fraction of their user comes back to their website. Gustavo need our help as a data analyst to increase their marketing conversion rate by doing more targeted marketing using customer segmentation so that it will not hurt their budget.
